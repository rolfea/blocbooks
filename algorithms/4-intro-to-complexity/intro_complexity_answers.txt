1. An algorithm that has O(1) time is Ken Warby's "Spirit of Australia", which set
the water speed record in 1978 (318 mph) while an algorithm with O(2**n) time is me
riding an iceberg being pushed by a sleepy walrus.

2. The best case scenario for a binary search is constant time (O(1)), where the value
is the first encountered item in the search.

3. The worst case scenario for a binary search is logarithmic time (O(log n)), where the value
is the last item in one half of the binary search (either the highest or lowest value).

4. The bounded case scenario is also logarithmic time, consulting some amount of values that are less than half
of the searched collection, but more than 1.

7. The Big-O of this set of data is quadratic, or O(n**2).

8.
def linear_search(array, value)
  input_size = 0
  return if array.empty?
  array.each_index do |i|
    input_size += 1
    if array[i] == value
      return "Value after #{i + 1} iterations. Input size was: #{input_size}"
    end
  end
end


10. Big-O of Binary Search is O(log n).

11. Big-Omega of Binary search is also O(log n).

12. Big-Theta of Binary Search is O(1).
